### Takeaway
There's nothing to say much about post method. Nevertheless, it's good to recall the concept I've known shallowly.  
I've known about the Postman while self-studying backend, but never used it. So I'm glad to use the Postman in this time.  
Issues when copy-pasting the stuff is well-knwon, not only in coding situation. I didn't face the issue today, but should be careful with that.
#### Revision by ChatGPT 3.5
"There's not much to say about the POST method. Nevertheless, it's good to refresh my understanding of the concept, which I've only grasped superficially.

I've come across Postman while self-studying backend development but have never used it until now. So, I'm glad to finally utilize Postman at this time.

Issues related to copy-pasting content are well-known, not only in coding situations. Fortunately, I didn't encounter any issues today, but I should remain cautious in the future."
