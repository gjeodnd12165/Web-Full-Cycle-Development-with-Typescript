### Takeaway
Now it's getting more serious as I feel much 'development experience' then before.  
I have made some server with guide on internet, but never built a structure of a server API by drawing pages.  
I'm so excited to learn more about the concepts that I used without knowing-well.

I'm really excited to learn more about the concepts that I've been using without fully understanding."
