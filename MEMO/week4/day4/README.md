1. forEach()
2. map()
3. DELETE 메소드
4. 예외 처리
5. 리팩토링
6. PUT 메소드
7. HTTP 상태 코드


### Takeaway
I've been using forEach and map well, so there's nothing to say about that, same as DELETE method and PUT methods.  
Refactoring is one of the things that I've heard but not known well. So it's glad to know about it.  
Finally, I think I should investigate about HTTP status codes. There's a lot more than I thought!

"I've been using forEach and map effectively, so there's not much to say about them, the same goes for the DELETE and PUT methods.

Refactoring is something I've heard about but haven't fully understood. So, I'm glad to learn more about it.

Finally, I believe I should investigate HTTP status codes further. There's a lot more to them than I initially thought!"
